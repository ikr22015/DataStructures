Linked List:

    One of the disadvantage of using arrays to to store data is that arrays are static structures and
    therefor cannot be easily extended or reduced to fit the data set.

    A linked list is a liner data structure where each element is a separate object.
    Each element (we'll call it a node) of a list is comprising of two items - the 'data' and a 'reference'
    to the first node. The last node has a reference to null. The entry point into a lined list is
    called the head of the list.

Type of linked list:

    === A singly linked list.
    === A doubly linked list.
        That has two references, one to the next node and another to previous node.

Linked list data fetching is slower than Array. But you can extend you element very easily
but on array, you can not extend or expand element. Because array's elements are been fixed.
